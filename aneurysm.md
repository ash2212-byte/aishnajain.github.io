# Computational Analysis Of Cerebral Aneurysm

## Overview
Constructed a two dimensional model of an IA benchmark aneurysm model to primarily investigate shear stress on the wall, pressure distribution and velocity recirculation, to study aneurysm rupture.

## My Role
- Constructed two dimensional model of a cranial artery
- Applied the Carreau viscosity model to simulate blood as a Non-Newtonian Fluid.
- Validated against results from literature

## Tools Used
- Ansys Fluent
- Ansys Workbench

## Results
- Identified flow recirculation zones inside the bulge.
- Characteristed the zones with varying behaviour of flow-wall interactions
- Contributed to a better understanding of formation of thrombus and early prevention of aneursym ruptures.

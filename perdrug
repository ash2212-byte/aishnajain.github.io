# Numerical Study Of Drug Diffusion through Human Skin

## Overview
The study aimed at analyzing the expansion potential of non-invasive drug delivery through the human skin into the bloodstream. It utilized the chemical characteristics of certain drugs, and studied their effectiveness using an in-house developed MATLAB code, based on Fick's Law.
Addtionally, the study also carried out the novel work to decomputationally model the outermost human skin-layer to study its resistance.

## My Role
- Expanded study by including five significant drugs important to human medicine.
- Analyzed enhancement techniques, particularly using chemical permeation enhancers.
- Modelled the stratum corenum to be biologically accurate to physically visualize the resistance it offers to drug diffusion.
- Studied the effect of wettability on diffusion using created model.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- COMSOL
- Excel

## Results
- Identified the optimal permeation enhancers, and quantified their multifold increase in diffusion.
- Established wettability as a significant contributor to the the study, a parameter that had not been considered in existing studies.
- Created COMSOL model allowed better visualization and aided in easily manipulating parameters to further study effects of aging.

# Flow Separation and Control around a high-speed low-pressure turbine blade
## Overview
Performed high fidelity simulations to study flow separation in the transonic regime under multiple flow conditions

## My Role
- Calculated braking force distribution and pedal ratio
- Selected caliper and disc specifications
- Modeled braking performance in MATLAB
- Ensured compliance with eBAJA rulebook

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks
- MATLAB
- ANSYS
- Excel

## Results
- Achieved stable braking performance under all load cases
- Passed all technical inspections
- Contributed to overall vehicle reliability
